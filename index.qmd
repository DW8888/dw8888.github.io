## Data Engineer | Data Scientist

I am a data professional with a strong foundation in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. I recently completed a **Master of Science in Data Science**, where I worked extensively with real-world datasets, statistical modeling, and end-to-end data workflows.

I have hands-on experience using **Python, SQL, and R** to build data pipelines, perform feature engineering, and develop machine learning models. My work spans academic projects and personal builds, with a focus on reproducibility, clear evaluation, and practical decision-making.

I am currently seeking a **junior data engineering or data-focused role** where I can continue developing scalable data systems while contributing meaningfully to a team.
