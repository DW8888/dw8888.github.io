    "text": "Profile\n\n\nDarwhin Gomez is a data and software engineer with a strong foundation in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. He recently completed a Master of Science in Data Science from the School of Professional Studies at the City University of New York, where he worked extensively with real-world datasets, statistical modeling, and end-to-end data workflows. His experience includes building data pipelines, performing feature engineering, and developing machine learning models using Python, SQL, and R, with an emphasis on reproducibility, evaluation rigor, and practical decision-making.\nIn 2025, he interned as a Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where he designed and deployed AI-powered solutions across multiple AWS services with a focus on scalability, reliability, and performance. In 2024, he interned as a Software and Product Developer at WOPLLI, contributing to research and proof-of-concept development for Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) systems, as well as building a web application for issuing and managing digital credentials. He also served as a Help Desk Intern with the Office of Technology for the Mayor of New York City, providing technical support and troubleshooting for city employees.\nWhile pursuing his Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems Technology from the New York City College of Technology, Darwhin worked as a Teaching Assistant for IT courses through the Research Foundation of the City University of New York, supporting students in professional IT systems and support coursework.\nOutside of his professional work, Darwhin is a devoted husband and father of two. He enjoys spending time with his family, exploring emerging technologies, reading epic fantasy and science fiction, and following New York sports.",
